        <p class="description"> The Department of Labor and Employment's (DOLE) Special Program for Employment of Students, commonly known as SPES, serves as a bridging program that aims to offer employment opportunities to students, assisting them in their pursuit of education.
            This program allows students to engage in short-term employment during summer breaks, enabling them to earn funds for their educational expenses and other financial needs. However, the conventional face-to-face registration and renewal process
            poses challenges for both applicants and the responsible agency.</p>
